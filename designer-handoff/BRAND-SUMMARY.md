## Colors

| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| **Ink** | `#1a1612` | Primary dark / backgrounds |
| **Gilt** | `#f9f6ec` | Primary light / text on dark |
| **Brass** | `#c9a961` | Accent / CTAs / highlights |
| **Brass Dark** | `#a88b4a` | Accent variation (charts, depth) |
| **Brass Light** | `#d4b872` | Hover states |

### Why Brass?

1. **Complements the core palette** — Works beautifully with Ink and Gilt. Brass sits naturally between those warm, sophisticated tones.

2. **Evokes the brand concept** — A lectern is traditionally associated with knowledge, authority, and craftsmanship. Brass is a classic material used in quality lecterns, library fixtures, and scholarly settings—think brass reading lamps, decorative hardware, and antique book fittings.

3. **Warmth and approachability** — Unlike a cold metallic gold or a stark yellow, brass has an aged, warm quality that feels trustworthy and established without being flashy. It suggests expertise without arrogance.

4. **Differentiation** — Material colors like brass carry inherent meaning and associations that generic tech colors don't. Purple, blue, or green are essentially arbitrary—they "feel techy" but don't reinforce what a brand actually is. Brass grounds the brand in something tangible: the subconscious connection to a well-made desk lamp, a library nameplate, quality hardware. It's the difference between a brand that *looks* like a tech company and one that *feels* like something with substance.

5. **Versatility** — Works well as both an accent for buttons/CTAs (with gilt text for contrast) and in data visualizations where you need color variations (darker/lighter brass tones for charts).

### Why Fraunces?

Fraunces bridges two worlds—the credibility of traditional publishing and the energy of a modern tech product.

- **Editorial heritage** — Evokes the feel of quality publications, books, and journalism—fitting for a brand about getting cited and published in authoritative sources
- **Modern SaaS energy** — Unlike stiff traditional serifs, Fraunces has soft, slightly wonky letterforms that feel fresh and approachable—right at home in a tech product UI without feeling corporate or dated
- **Visibility as a concept** — The typeface has high contrast and expressive curves that command attention on screen, reinforcing what Lectern helps brands achieve: being seen
- **Variable font** — As a modern variable font, it offers fine control over weight and optical size, making it technically versatile across headlines, dashboards, and marketing

**Brief history**: Fraunces was designed by Phaedra Charles and released by Undercase Type in 2020. It was inspired by early 20th century "Old Style" display typefaces. The name comes from the historic Fraunces Tavern in New York City, where George Washington gave his farewell address—tying it to American history and oratory tradition.

**Personal connection**: The founders frequently grab drinks and food on the same street as Fraunces Tavern after working at a WeWork nearby—an unplanned but meaningful coincidence that makes this typeface choice feel even more right for the brand.

## Logo Construction

### Icon

The icon consists of three horizontal bars with varying opacity and a tapered top bar. It works on multiple levels:

1. **Reporting visualization** — The bars represent the reporting you see in the Lectern product—where you currently stand against your competitors. The opacity gradient shows a natural sense of progress being made rightward.

2. **Abstract lectern shape** — The top bar is tapered/skewed to create the natural angled top of a lectern. Abstractly, the icon reads as a lectern silhouette, tying directly to the brand name.

3. **Content/writing metaphor** — The bars also evoke a text editor or content app, representing writing on a page. This connects to the content creation and publishing side of the business.

4. **Upward momentum** — The skewed top bar suggests growth and forward progress, reinforcing what Lectern helps brands achieve.

The icon successfully hits multiple areas of the business—visibility reporting, content creation, and the brand name itself—while remaining simple and versatile.

### Lockup Rules
- Icon height matches the **cap height of the "L"** in the wordmark

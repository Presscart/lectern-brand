## Company Identity

**Who We Are:**
Lectern is the content intelligence platform for AEO and GEO that helps growth-stage brands turn AI visibility into traffic and revenue.

**One-Sentence Summary:**
Lectern helps growth-stage brands get recommended by AI through content intelligence and execution.

**Origin:**
Built by the founders of Presscart, a media marketplace developed over four years with publishing relationships across 1,400+ credible outlets including TechCrunch, VentureBeat, Architectural Digest, USA Today, and more.

---

## Lectern & Presscart: Public Positioning

**The Rule:**
- **Company-level marketing:** Lectern stands on its own. Don't mention Presscart directly.
- **Founder-level marketing:** The Presscart relationship is fair game as industry experience.

**Why This Distinction:**

| Context | Mention Presscart? | Rationale |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Website, ads, product marketing | No | Customers don't care where publications come from—they care they have access |
| Founder bios, podcasts, interviews | Yes | Presscart is a credibility layer—4 years of media industry experience |
| Sales conversations | Case-by-case | If asked about network origin, the backstory adds trust |
| Investor conversations | Yes | Shows moat origin and defensibility |

**How to Talk About It:**

*At the company level:*
> "Lectern provides access to 1,400+ credible publications for offsite citations."

*At the founder level:*
> "We spent four years building Presscart, a media marketplace connecting brands with publishers. That's where the network came from—and why no one else has it."

**The Benefit:**
Customers naturally discover the Presscart connection through Tyler and Edgar's personal brands. This creates an "earned" credibility moment rather than a forced marketing message. They learn about the depth of the network organically, which feels more authentic than leading with it.

## The Lectern Difference

### What Competitors Can Do vs. What They Can't

| Execution Type | Competitors | Lectern |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| Onsite content optimization | ✅ Can guide clients | ✅ Yes |
| Technical optimizations | ⚠️ Some, varies | ✅ Yes |

**The Summary:**
> Competitors can help you optimize your site. Lectern gets you cited everywhere else.

## Competitive Positioning by Competitor

### vs. Profound

| Dimension | Profound | Lectern |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **HQ** | NYC (SF, London) | NYC |
| **Funding** | $58.5M (Sequoia, KP, Khosla) | Self-funded |
| **Team** | Hiring actively (63 openings) | 8 |
| **Audience** | Enterprise brands | Growth-stage founders |
| **Offering** | Intelligence + Content Creation | Intelligence + Execution (onsite & offsite) |
| **Onsite** | ✅ Workflows (content creation) | ✅ Content creation & optimization |
| **Offsite** | ❌ None | ✅ 1,400+ outlets |
| **Pricing** | $499/mo Lite, Enterprise custom | Accessible |

**Profound's Gap:** Intelligence + content creation, but NO distribution. Clients must publish themselves. High entry price ($499/mo).
**Your Advantage:** Lectern does both onsite AND offsite execution. You close the gap, not just show it.

---

### vs. AirOps

| Dimension | AirOps | Lectern |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **HQ** | San Francisco | NYC |
| **Funding** | $62.5M at $225M valuation | Self-funded |
| **Team** | ~100 | 8 |
| **Focus** | Content engineering | Content intelligence + execution |
| **Onsite** | ✅ Page360, Power Agents, content refresh | ✅ Content creation & optimization |
| **Offsite** | ❌ None | ✅ 1,400+ outlets |
| **Positioning** | Content production at scale | AI visibility outcomes |
| **Metric** | Content velocity | Traffic & revenue |

**AirOps' Gap:** DIRECT COMPETITOR on onsite content. They do content creation and refresh—same as Lectern. But they're onsite-only. No publishing network.
**Your Advantage:** Lectern matches AirOps on onsite AND adds offsite execution through 1,400+ publisher network. They have one capability; you have two.

---

### vs. Conductor

| Dimension | Conductor | Lectern |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **HQ** | NYC (Berlin via Searchmetrics) | NYC |
| **Funding** | $211M at $525M valuation | Self-funded |
| **Team** | 300+ | 8 |
| **Founded** | 2006 (19 years old) | 2025 (purpose-built for AI) |
| **Origin** | Legacy SEO, retrofitting for AI | Purpose-built for AEO |
| **Target** | Enterprise only ($2K-$10K+/mo) | Growth-stage founders |
| **Onsite** | ✅ Conductor AI, ContentKing | ✅ Content creation & optimization |
| **Offsite** | ❌ None | ✅ 1,400+ outlets |
| **Sales Cycle** | Long enterprise procurement | Fast, founder-led |

**Conductor's Gap:** 19-year-old SEO company trying to become an AI company. Enterprise-only with long sales cycles. No offsite publishing. Cluttered positioning.
**Your Advantage:** Purpose-built for AEO, growth-stage friendly pricing, 1,400+ publisher network. You're nimble; they're legacy.

---

### vs. Soogle

| Dimension | Soogle | Lectern |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Focus | SEO/backlinks | AI visibility |
| Network | Micro-partners ($67/mo) | Curated 1,400+ outlets |
| Sophistication | Basic automation | Comprehensive intelligence |

**Soogle's Gap:** Backlinks-focused, not true AI visibility.
**Your Advantage:** Comprehensive AI visibility across 5 models + curated publishing.

---

### vs. Unusual

| Dimension | Unusual | Lectern |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **HQ** | San Francisco | NYC |
| **Funding** | $3.6M (YC F24) | Self-funded |
| **Team** | 2 (founders only) | 8 |
| **Founded** | 2024 (launched Sep 2025) | 2025 |
| **Focus** | AI perception ("AI Relations") | AI visibility + execution |
| **Approach** | Treats AI as "influencer" to manage | Full AEO/GEO execution |
| **Content** | ✅ Self-hosted on unusual.ai only | ✅ Creation & optimization |
| **Onsite** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Offsite Publishing** | ❌ No external outlets | ✅ 1,400+ outlets |
| **Distribution** | ❌ None | ✅ Proven publisher network |

**Unusual's Gap:** No publishing network—they create content but can only host it on their own platform (llms.unusual.ai). They approached Lectern for offsite help. Lectern declined. The distribution network is the moat.

**Your Advantage:** Lectern does everything Unusual does (AI perception, content creation, onsite optimization) PLUS offsite execution through 1,400+ outlets. They're trying to compete in AEO without the distribution that makes it work. Their outreach proves the moat.

---

### vs. Mentionary

| Dimension | Mentionary | Lectern |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Focus | Monitoring/tracking | Intelligence + Execution |
| Transparency | Unknown funding/team | Clear origin story |
| Execution | Unclear capabilities | Proven publishing network |

**Mentionary's Gap:** Monitoring-focused without clear execution.
**Your Advantage:** You close the gap, not just measure it.

---

### vs. Peec AI

| Dimension | Peec AI | Lectern |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **HQ** | Berlin (expanding US) | NYC |
| **Funding** | $29M ($100M+ valuation) | Self-funded |
| **Team** | ~30 | 8 |
| **Customers** | 1,300+ (Datadog, Miro, Personio) | Growth-stage |
| **Focus** | Analytics + recommendations | Intelligence + execution |
| **Onsite** | ⚠️ Recommendations only | ✅ Full execution |
| **Offsite** | ❌ None | ✅ 1,400+ outlets |
| **Pricing** | €75-169/mo | Accessible |

**Peec AI's Gap:** Strong analytics and case studies (312% visibility for Personio), but no execution. Clients must implement recommendations themselves. No offsite publishing.
**Your Advantage:** Lectern provides the execution Peec AI lacks. You don't just show insights—you act on them across 1,400+ outlets.

---

### vs. Relixir

| Dimension | Relixir | Lectern |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **HQ** | Berkeley | NYC |
| **Funding** | YC X25 | Self-funded |
| **Team** | 2-5 | 8 |
| **Approach** | GEO-Native CMS | Content intelligence + execution |
| **Publishing** | Auto-publish to client sites only | Client sites + 1,400+ external outlets |
| **Offsite** | ❌ None | ✅ Full network |
| **Pricing** | $2,500/mo | Accessible |

**Relixir's Gap:** Interesting "GEO-Native CMS" angle, but auto-publishing only works for client's own properties. No external publisher relationships. Premium pricing excludes growth-stage.
**Your Advantage:** Lectern's network gets you cited on external sources that AI actually references—not just your own blog.

---

### vs. Anvil

| Dimension | Anvil | Lectern |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **HQ** | NYC | NYC |
| **Funding** | YC X25 | Self-funded |
| **Team** | 2-5 | 8 |
| **Founders** | Ex-Google, BlackRock, Goldman | Presscart (4 years publisher relationships) |
| **Focus** | Analytics for LLM search | Intelligence + execution |
| **Onsite** | ⚠️ Recommendations | ✅ Full execution |
| **Offsite** | ❌ None | ✅ 1,400+ outlets |

**Anvil's Gap:** Strong founding team from finance/tech, but analytics-only. No execution capability, no publisher network.
**Your Advantage:** Lectern's 4-year head start with Presscart means we have relationships Anvil would take years to build.

---

### vs. Evertune

| Dimension | Evertune | Lectern |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **HQ** | NYC | NYC |
| **Funding** | $19M (Felicis, Eniac) | Self-funded |
| **Team** | Trade Desk alumni | Presscart |
| **Target** | Fortune 500 | Growth-stage |
| **Pricing** | $3,000/mo | Accessible |
| **Focus** | Analytics + monitoring | Intelligence + execution |
| **Unique** | Shopping Intelligence (ChatGPT) | Publisher network |
| **Offsite** | ❌ None | ✅ 1,400+ outlets |

**Evertune's Gap:** Enterprise-only ($3K/mo minimum), analytics-focused with no execution capability. Strong Fortune 500 client list but can't help with offsite citations. Their Shopping Intelligence feature is innovative but narrow.
**Your Advantage:** Lectern serves growth-stage at accessible pricing while providing the offsite execution Evertune lacks. They show the gap; you close it.

---

### vs. Searchable

| Dimension | Searchable | Lectern |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **HQ** | London, UK | NYC |
| **Funding** | £4M (~$5M) at £40M valuation | Self-funded |
| **Team** | 3 founders (Verb exit + 2x YC) | 8 |
| **Founded** | 2025 (Nov launch) | 2025 |
| **Users** | 12,000+ | Growth-stage brands |
| **Focus** | Full AEO toolkit | Intelligence + execution |
| **Content** | ✅ Generation | ✅ Creation & optimization |
| **Onsite** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Offsite Publishing** | ❌ No external outlets | ✅ 1,400+ outlets |
| **Pricing** | $50-400/mo | Accessible |

**Searchable's Gap:** Full-stack AEO toolkit with affordable pricing ($50-400/mo) and rapid user growth (12K+), but no offsite publishing network. Content created must be published by clients themselves. UK-focused, expanding globally.
**Your Advantage:** Lectern matches Searchable's content and analytics capabilities while adding the offsite execution they lack. Both are growth-stage friendly, but Lectern gets you cited across 1,400+ outlets that AI actually references.

## Customer vs. User Terminology

**Our Distinction:**
- **Customers** = Companies that pay for Lectern (the business relationship)
- **Users** = Individuals at those companies who use the platform daily (the product relationship)

**The Philosophy:**
> "We sell to the customer, but we're most useful to the daily user. The driver of the car."

**How We Apply This:**
| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Customer | The company/account that signs the contract and pays | "Acme Corp is a customer" |
| User | The marketing manager, SEO lead, or founder who logs in daily | "Sarah is a Lectern user" |

**Why This Matters:**
- Sales talks to the customer (decision-maker, budget holder)
- Product is built for the user (daily operator, the one getting value)
- Success is measured when the user thrives, which keeps the customer paying

**Competitor Terminology Reference:**
| Competitor | Relational Term | Notes |
|------------|-----------------|-------|
| Profound | clients | Uses "clients" possessively |
| AirOps | customers | Uses "Customer Stories" section |
| Searchable | users | Emphasizes "12,000+ users" |
| Evertune | customers | Primary term, with "clients" secondary |
| Gumloop | users/customers | Uses both interchangeably |

---

## Target Audience

### Who Lectern Serves

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Company Stage | Growth-stage (Series A through C) |
| Funding Status | VC-backed with traction and trajectory |
| Decision Makers | Founders still close to GTM decisions |
| Team Size | Marketing teams present but lean (11-100) |
| Need | Execution alongside intelligence—not just dashboards |

### Ideal Client Profile

- Growth-stage, VC-backed company
- 11-100 employees
- Founder actively involved in marketing/growth
- Has product-market fit and is scaling
- Needs results, not just reports

**Example:** A YC-backed company, 11-50 employees, customers include recognizable brands, founder-led, marketing team present but lean.

### Not Core Focus

| Segment | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| Enterprise (today) | Longer sales cycles, procurement complexity |
| Early-stage startups | Without PMF, AI visibility is premature |
| Agencies | Built for founders, not intermediaries |

---

## Competitive Battle Cards

### When Prospect Mentions Profound

**Their Pitch:** "Enterprise AI visibility intelligence"
**Counter:** "Profound shows you where you're invisible. Then what? Lectern shows you AND gets you cited. Our 1,400+ publisher network is the execution they can't offer. Plus, we're built for growth-stage—no enterprise sales cycles."

### When Prospect Mentions AirOps

**Their Pitch:** "Content engineering at scale"
**Counter:** "AirOps helps you produce content. But content production isn't the same as AI visibility. Lectern measures how you show up in AI, then improves it—both onsite AND offsite through our publishing network."

### When Prospect Mentions Conductor

**Their Pitch:** "Enterprise AEO platform"
**Counter:** "Conductor is a 20-year-old SEO company retrofitting for AI. Lectern is purpose-built for AEO. We move faster, we're built for founders not procurement teams, and we have the publishing network to actually execute."

### When Prospect Mentions Unusual

**Their Pitch:** "AI Relations—we change how AI talks about your brand"
**Counter:** "Unusual can survey AI models and create content, but they can only host it on their own platform. Without distribution to credible external sources, their impact is limited. Lectern does everything they do—AI perception, content creation—AND we can actually get you cited through our 1,400+ publisher network. They even approached us for help with offsite. That tells you everything."

### When Prospect Mentions Peec AI

**Their Pitch:** "AI Search is the new SEO—we show you where you rank"
**Counter:** "Peec has solid analytics and some impressive case studies. But analytics alone don't get you citations. They show you the problem; you still have to fix it yourself. Lectern shows you the gap AND closes it through our 1,400+ publisher network. We don't just give recommendations—we execute."

### When Prospect Mentions Relixir

**Their Pitch:** "GEO-Native CMS that auto-publishes optimized content"
**Counter:** "Relixir's CMS is interesting, but they can only publish to your own properties. AI doesn't just look at your blog—it references external sources. Lectern gets you cited across 1,400+ credible outlets that AI actually trusts. Plus, at $2,500/mo, they're enterprise pricing for a startup feature set."

### When Prospect Mentions Anvil

**Their Pitch:** "AI Discovery Platform—analytics for LLM search"
**Counter:** "Anvil has strong founders from Google and Goldman, but they're an analytics company—they show you the data, not how to fix it. Lectern gives you the same visibility insights AND the execution through our publishing network. We've spent 4 years building relationships they'd take years to replicate."

### When Prospect Mentions Evertune

**Their Pitch:** "GEO platform for Fortune 500—we track AI visibility at scale"
**Counter:** "Evertune has impressive enterprise clients and their Shopping Intelligence feature is interesting. But at $3K/month, they're built for Fortune 500, not growth-stage. And like everyone else, they can only show you the problem—they have no publishing network for execution. Lectern gives you enterprise-grade insights at accessible pricing, plus we can actually get you cited through 1,400+ outlets."

### When Prospect Mentions Searchable

**Their Pitch:** "The AI-Powered Search Optimisation Tool Kit—AEO made accessible"
**Counter:** "Searchable has built an impressive toolkit at accessible pricing, and their user growth shows demand. But like everyone else in this space, they can only help you create content—they can't help you publish it where AI actually looks. Lectern gives you similar analytics and content capabilities, plus we can get you cited across 1,400+ outlets. They help you write; we help you get discovered."

## AI Visibility Maturity Model

Lectern's framework for setting expectations and measuring progress:

| Level | Goal | What It Means |
|-------|------|---------------|
| 1 | Existence | AI acknowledges your company exists |
| 2 | Product Awareness | AI knows what you sell |
| 3 | Accurate Representation | AI sells your products correctly when asked |
| 4 | Competitive Inclusion | AI includes you in category consideration |
| 5 | Recommendation | AI actively recommends you ahead of competitors |

**How to Use:**
- Sales: Set realistic expectations (no jumping from 1 to 5)
- Onboarding: Establish baseline
- Reporting: Show progress through levels
- Content: Educate prospects on the journey

---

## Tone & Voice Reminders

### What We Sound Like
- A smart founder explaining their company to another founder
- Clear, concise, no jargon for jargon's sake
- Confident without being arrogant
- Helpful without being salesy

### What We Don't Sound Like
- Enterprise software marketing ("end-to-end solutions")
- Hype-driven startup speak ("revolutionize," "disrupt")
- Vague or hedging ("potentially improve")
- Overly technical without purpose

| **vs. Conductor** | Legacy SEO, enterprise-only, no offsite | Purpose-built for AI, growth-stage friendly, offsite execution |
| **vs. Unusual** | Self-hosted content only, no external publishing | They approached Lectern for help—we have what they need |
| **vs. Peec AI** | Analytics only, no execution capability | Same insights + full execution capability |
| **vs. Relixir** | Auto-publishes to client sites only | External citations on credible sources |
| **vs. Anvil** | Analytics-focused, no execution | 4-year head start on publisher relationships |
| **vs. Evertune** | Enterprise-only ($3K/mo), no offsite | Growth-stage pricing + full execution |
| **vs. Searchable** | Full AEO toolkit but no offsite publishing | Same content capabilities + 1,400+ outlet network |

**Summary:** All competitors can help with some form of onsite content or analytics. Only Lectern can secure citations on external sources through the publisher network built over 4 years with Presscart. This is the moat.

## Product Philosophy: Agent-First, Not Platform-First

### The Core Insight

Building a platform is the old way. Users shouldn't have to log into Lectern to get value from Lectern.

**The Vacuum vs. Roomba Analogy:**
- **Vacuum cleaner:** "Here's the best tool to clean your carpet. Good luck."
- **Roomba:** Pre-map your home, set a cadence, and it handles everything—asking for input only when needed.

Lectern is the Roomba. Or the DJI agricultural drone that pre-maps your field and sprays accordingly, staying within the lines, asking for approvals when needed.

### Where Lectern Lives

The platform still exists—and for users who prefer it, they can access everything there. But our goal is to make logging in optional, not required.

| Interface | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Slack / Teams | Primary home—where daily work happens |
| CMS integration | Direct publishing pipeline |
| Dashboard | Available for power users, deep analysis, or preference |

**The belief:** If a user has to log into Lectern to get value, they won't use it. Another login is friction. Another tab is cognitive load. We meet them where they already are.

**The goal:** A user might forget their Lectern password because they never need to log in. That's not abandonment—that's integration done right.

**Industry validation:** This mirrors the emerging pattern across enterprise software. As Max Brodeur-Urbas put it: *"I use Salesforce every day but haven't logged in for months... Learn to build agents and let them interface with everything else."* The productivity breakthrough isn't mastering software UIs—it's building agents that bridge the gap between users and systems.

### The Agent Workflow (Example)

```
1. Lectern agent detects: Competitor published new article on [topic]
                          ↓
2. Agent analyzes: "This article may score well for [specific query]"
                          ↓
3. Agent notifies user in Slack:
   "Competitor X published [article]. It targets [query] where you rank #3.
    Should I create content on [adjacent topic] to compete?"
                          ↓
4. User responds: ✅ Approve / ❌ Deny
                          ↓
5. [If approved] Agent generates content draft
                          ↓
6. Agent notifies: "Draft ready for review"
                          ↓
7. User responds: ✅ Approve / ✏️ Edit / ❌ Deny
                          ↓
8. [If approved] Agent pushes to CMS via integration
                          ↓
9. Content live. User did 2 clicks total.
```

### What Users Actually Do

The user's job becomes:
- **Setup:** Map their "field" (competitors, queries, goals, aggression level)
- **Monitor:** Review what the agent surfaces
- **Approve:** Greenlight actions the agent recommends
- **Escalate:** Get approvals from leadership when needed

They're not doing the work. They're managing a system that does the work. Just enough involvement to justify their role to an employer, but not so much that they're buried in execution.

### The Five-Steps-Ahead Principle

We don't give users tools and expect them to figure it out. We think five steps ahead:

| Traditional Platform | Lectern Agent-First |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| "Here's your visibility data" | "Here's a problem, here's the fix, approve?" |
| "Create a content brief" | "I created a brief for [gap]. Review?" |
| "Publish when ready" | "Approved content pushed to your CMS" |
| User drives every action | Agent drives, user approves |
| Daily login required | Slack notifications only |

### Why This Matters Strategically

1. **Stickiness:** If Lectern is in their Slack, their CMS, their workflow—it's infrastructure, not a tool
2. **Value delivery:** Users see results without effort, which proves ROI faster
3. **Differentiation:** Competitors build dashboards. We build agents.
4. **Future-proofing:** AI-native architecture from day one, not retrofitted

### Tier 3 as the Full Expression

The agent-first philosophy reaches full expression in Tier 3 (Hybrid):

| Component | How It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| Private Slack channel | Direct line to agent + team |
| Slack integrations | Automated notifications, approvals in-channel |
| CMS integrations | One-click publish from approval |
| Custom integrations | On-site visits to build exactly what they need |
| Strategy calls | Human layer for complex decisions |

Tier 2 users get the intelligence. Tier 3 users get the autonomous system.

### The North Star

> The best outcome is a user who says: "I don't really use Lectern. It just... runs. I approve things in Slack and content shows up on my site."

That's not disengagement. That's success.

## Future Opportunity: AI Commerce & Shopping Intelligence

### The Shift: Google's Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)

In January 2026, Google launched the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)—an open-source standard developed with Shopify, Etsy, and Walmart. UCP enables AI agents to complete full shopping transactions (discovery, checkout, discounts) within conversational interfaces.

**What this changes:**
- Before UCP: AI recommends products, but users leave to complete purchase
- After UCP: AI agents can discover, compare, and checkout—all in one conversation

### What Can Be Optimized

| Layer | Optimizable? | How |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| Product data quality | Yes | Structured JSON manifests, capability schemas for UCP discovery |
| Product descriptions | Yes | AI-optimized descriptions that answer shopping queries |
| Review/reputation signals | Yes | Third-party content AI references when making recommendations |
| Pricing/availability | Yes | Real-time accurate data AI trusts |
| Recommendation algorithm | No | Opaque AI model decisions |
| Native AI placement | Probably paid | Likely evolves into AI Shopping ads |

### Where Lectern's Moat Applies

When AI recommends products, it cites sources. Those sources include:
- Buyer's guides ("Best standing desks for home offices")
- Expert roundups ("Top 10 CRM tools for startups")
- Review sites and product comparisons

**The play:** Lectern can place content in those sources through the 1,400+ publisher network. This influences what AI recommends.

| Competitor | Shopping Intelligence | Execution |
|------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Evertune | ✅ Tracks ChatGPT shopping recommendations | ❌ No offsite influence |
| Lectern (future) | ✅ Could track AI shopping flows | ✅ Can influence via offsite placements |

### Current Status

- **Evertune:** First mover on Shopping Intelligence (ChatGPT-focused)
- **Lectern:** Not in MVP scope, but natural extension of moat for e-commerce/DTC customers

### When to Prioritize

Consider adding Shopping Intelligence when:
1. E-commerce or DTC brands become a significant customer segment
2. UCP adoption reaches critical mass
3. Clear ROI can be demonstrated (offsite → AI recommendation → conversion)

**Note:** This extends the existing moat rather than requiring new capabilities. The insight is that product recommendations follow the same citation logic as informational queries—AI references credible external sources.

## Section 1: Company Identity

### Who We Are

Lectern is the content intelligence agent for AEO that turns AI visibility into revenue without adding headcount or work to your plate.

The agent measures how your brand shows up across AI models, reports on gaps and opportunities, builds a plan to close those gaps, and then executes that plan autonomously. You approve the direction, the agent handles execution, and your inbox fills with progress throughout the day.

### The One-Sentence Summary

Lectern is an AI visibility agent that measures your gaps, plans your strategy, and executes the work so you don't have to.

### What We're Building

Other platforms in this space built better vacuums. Powerful tools you still have to push around yourself.

Lectern is more like a Roomba. You set it up, give it a goal, and it runs. While you're sleeping, while you're in meetings, while you're focused on higher-level work, the job is getting done. Your inbox fills with completed tasks throughout the day, not tasks to do.

Other platforms tell you what you should do. Lectern tells you what got done.

### Building for the Agentic Future

Today, Lectern communicates with humans via Slack, Teams, email, or in-platform if that's what they prefer (though they should think of the platform as home base, a rarity to enter if needed).

Tomorrow, Lectern communicates with other agents. A company's revenue agent identifies a growth opportunity and autonomously engages Lectern's visibility agent to execute. Content gets created. Placements get secured. Traffic increases. Revenue follows.

Minimal human input. Agents coordinating with agents.

We're not just building for how work gets done today. We're building for a world where AI visibility is managed by AI and humans oversee outcomes, not tasks.

### Our Origin

Lectern was built by the founders of Presscart, a media marketplace developed over four years with publishing relationships across 1,400+ credible outlets. That network is now the execution engine for offsite content, which is the reason Lectern can actually place content where AI looks, not just recommend that you should.

### Category Definition

Lectern operates in the AEO space, but we're not a platform. We're an agent.

**Platforms** give you dashboards, recommendations, and tools. You do the work.

**Agents** take direction, execute autonomously, and report back with results.

The platform exists as a home base, a place to set things up, update high-level information, and download reports when needed. Think of it like the Roomba app: you don't need it daily, you might forget your login, but it's there when something needs adjusting.

Day-to-day, Lectern lives where you already work: Slack, Teams, or email. You communicate with the agent like a colleague. You approve work. You provide context. Throughout the day, you see progress.

---

## Section 2: The Problem We Solve

### The Shift in Consumer Behavior

Consumers aren't just searching anymore, they're asking. AI models like ChatGPT, Gemini, Google AI Overviews, Perplexity, Claude, and Grok are becoming trusted advisors that influence purchasing decisions.

When AI recommends a brand, it doesn't feel like advertising. It feels like advice from a source the user already trusts.

The more consumers use AI, the more they trust its recommendations. AI is becoming another trusted voice in the conversation, personalized to you with your best interest in mind, like a friend with good taste, a knowledgeable salesperson, or an expert colleague.

### Visibility Is Eroding

Brands that don't show up in AI conversations aren't just invisible to a growing segment of buyers, they're losing visibility with their existing segment.

We're already seeing reports showing clicks on Google Search results are way down as users increasingly find their answer in AI Overviews and other models. That first-page presence companies spent years building? It's worth less every day.

### The Gap in the Market

Most companies have:

- **No visibility** into how AI represents their brand
- **No awareness** of whether AI knows their products exist
- **No insight** into whether AI recommends their competitors over them
- **No capability** to improve their AI presence, even if they identify the problem
- **No strategy** to train AI to become a tool for their brand, a genuine ambassador that speaks about their product in a way that actually helps the person asking and positions the brand well

It's not just about presence. It's about the ability to influence how AI talks about you.

### The Real Problem: Work Piles Up

Even when companies find tools that can help, those tools create more work. More dashboards to check. More recommendations to interpret. More tasks to execute. More hiring to scale. And critically, analysis paralysis.

Today's AEO work is overwhelming:

- You get a report showing gaps. Now you have to figure out what to do about it.
- You get content recommendations. Now you have to write or commission that content.
- You get a list of offsite opportunities. Now you have to figure out how to place content there.
- You get competitive analysis. Now you have to decide how to respond.

Every insight becomes a task. Every task requires headcount, agency retainers, or your own time. The work piles up. The inbox fills. And most of it is unsexy execution work that pulls you away from higher-level thinking.

The industry sold you on the problem (AI visibility matters) but left you to solve it yourself.

And if you're an agency, you're selling that problem with you as the solution. But increasing headcount and lackluster results are cutting into client retention and revenue.

### What People Are Used To

People are conditioned to dread their inbox. Every Slack notification, every email is a reminder of work piling up. More to do. More to address. More to delegate. More people to train. More stress on hiring.

The current model: Wake up, see what needs to be done, point fingers, explain tasks, wait for execution, review, repeat.

This is exhausting. It doesn't scale without scaling headcount. And it doesn't even speak to the person tasked with the execution, the one actually doing the work while everyone waits.

### What Should Happen Instead

You should wake up to progress. And throughout the day, you should see more of it.

Not a list of things to do. Not recommendations to interpret. Not tasks to assign. Progress.

Updates on work completed overnight. Tasks executed while you slept. And as the day goes on, more tasks getting done, movement toward your goals without you lifting a finger.

That's a dopaminergic win first thing in the morning. You open your inbox and see momentum. It sets the tone for the day. And throughout the day, the momentum continues. More updates. More completed work. More progress.

It frees your mind for the work that actually requires your brain.

Lectern pays for itself because it allows a single person to oversee it all and manage the entire process without the additional hire and without waiting on execution time.

---

## Section 3: Our Solution

### Two Things Competitors Cannot Offer Together

**1. Full-Spectrum Execution**

Competitors can help with part of the execution:
- They can generate content recommendations
- They can help you draft blog posts
- They can integrate with your CMS to publish onsite content

But when it comes to offsite execution, securing placements on credible external sources that AI actually references, they have nothing. You're on your own.

And alongside that gap, they add more work. More recommendations to interpret. More tasks to execute. More things on your plate.

Lectern executes across the full spectrum:
- **Onsite:** Content optimization, refreshes, new content creation
- **Offsite:** Placements across 1,400+ credible outlets through our publishing network

This is also a moat. Competitors in this space have no non-software defensibility. When big AI firms can spin up software-based competitors quickly, the only protection is something they can't replicate overnight. Our four years of publisher relationships across 1,400+ outlets is that protection.

**2. Autonomous Execution**

Even where competitors can help execute, they don't actually do the work autonomously. They help with content creation, briefs, content ideas, recommendations for offsite places to target for outreach, with some help from AI. But nothing particularly autonomous. At the end of the day, you're still doing the work.

Other platforms tell you what you should do. Lectern tells you what got done.

Lectern doesn't hand you a to-do list. The agent takes direction, executes autonomously, and reports back with results. You approve the plan, the agent handles execution, and your inbox fills with progress throughout the day.

### The Lectern Difference

| | Competitors | Lectern |
|---|-------------|---------|
| **Onsite content** | Recommendations + AI-assisted tools | Agent executes |
| **Offsite content** | No capability | Agent places via 1,400+ outlets |
| **Workflow** | You do the work (with some AI help) | Agent does the work (with your approval) |
| **Communication** | Log into dashboard | Slack, Teams, Email |
| **Output** | "Here's what to do" | "Here's what we did" |

### What Execution Actually Means

When we say Lectern executes, we mean:

- **Content gets created** (not recommended, created) pending your approval
- **Content gets optimized** (not flagged for optimization, optimized) pending your approval
- **Content gets published** onsite through CMS integration (on roadmap), offsite through our publisher network
- **Competitors get monitored** with recommendations on how to respond, then execution of that response
- **Progress gets reported** delivered to you in Slack, Teams, or email as completed work

You ultimately have a say. But once you approve, the action is taken. You're not managing a tool. You're overseeing an agent.

That's the difference between being an analyst handling day-to-day ops and being a Director overseeing the work and managing at a high level.

### Freeing You Up

The reason we built Lectern as an agentic workflow, not just another platform, is to free up time.

**For the user of the product** (the AEO analyst, the marketing manager):

You go from grinding through execution to overseeing strategy. From analyst to Director of AI Visibility. You get the power of a performance marketing team without the overhead.

**For the customer buying the product** (the founder, CRO, CEO, CMO):

- Your team's time is freed to work on higher-level problems
- You don't need to scale headcount to scale output
- The optimized content drives high-intent traffic and revenue

**For agencies:**

You scale without the constant need to hire. You supervise execution rather than do it. You focus on sales and client relationships instead of fulfillment. Headcount stays flat while output grows.

---

## Section 4: The Lectern Workflow

### A Linear Path to Outcomes

Lectern follows a linear workflow designed to create goal-driven outcomes. Each phase builds on the last. You move from understanding to action to results.

**The Five Phases:**

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **1. Measuring** | The agent assesses how your brand shows up across AI models |
| **2. Reporting** | Shows you where you stand, where the gaps are against competitors being ranked ahead of you, and where opportunity exists |
| **3. Planning** | Lectern builds a strategy to close those gaps; you optimize and give the green light |
| **4. Executing** | The agent does the work, onsite and offsite |
| **5. Outcome Generating** | Traffic increases, revenue follows, goals get hit |

Lectern users use the product at every stage of their AEO work. This isn't a tool for one part of the process; it's the entire process, handled.

---

### Phase 1: Measuring

It starts with information about your company:
- Who you are
- Who your competitors are
- What makes you stand out in the market
- Anything else that helps develop context

From there, Lectern runs an AI visibility report. This measures how your brand currently shows up across the AI models that matter: ChatGPT, Gemini, Google AI Overviews, Perplexity, Claude, Grok, and others.

---

### Phase 2: Reporting

The visibility report shows you where you stand:

- **Which topics or queries** you're significantly lacking in
- **Which opportunities** would drive the biggest gains toward high-intent search and increased revenue
- **Where that stands relative to competitors** who's being ranked ahead of you and why
- **Where we can take action** the specific levers to pull
- **What content should be published** and where
- **How often** optimized content should be pushed to show up in search on the models your consumers actually use

This isn't a generic report. It's a strategic assessment tailored to your business, your competitors, and your goals.

**Reporting matters beyond just strategy.** We think reporting is a huge part of Lectern and we want to make it as easy as possible to download and share:

- **For agencies:** Show clients the progress being made on their behalf
- **For users:** Show higher-ups the results and justify the investment
- **For leadership (CROs, CMOs, founders):** Analyze where the company is headed, identify areas for improvement, and share with investors or key stakeholders like the board

Reports should be shareable, insightful, and easy to access, whether downloaded from the platform or sent directly via the agent.

---

### Phase 3: Planning

Once you understand your gaps, Lectern creates an effective plan. You optimize it and give the green light.

Plans include:

- **Offsite opportunities** to pursue within a defined period
- **Content refresh priorities** where existing content is confusing AI or misrepresenting your brand
- **New content opportunities** what needs to be created to show up for specific queries
- **Competitor response strategy** what your competition is doing and how to combat it with content of your own

The goal is always the same: drive high-intent revenue, build traffic, and ultimately have AI models become genuine ambassadors for your brand. Not just mentioning you, but speaking about your product the way your best advocate would, helping the person asking while positioning your brand well. Every action in the plan ties back to that outcome.

---

### Phase 4: Executing

This is where Lectern diverges from every competitor.

Once the plan is approved, the agent executes:

- **Onsite content** gets created and optimized (you upload to your CMS for now; CMS integration is on the roadmap so the agent can publish directly in the future)
- **Offsite content** gets placed across our network of 1,400+ credible outlets
- **Competitor movements** get monitored and responded to
- **Progress updates** get delivered to you wherever you work

You're not doing the work. You're approving the work. The agent handles execution while you handle higher-level thinking.

---

### Phase 5: Outcome Generating

Execution drives outcomes:

- **Increased visibility** across the AI models that matter
- **Higher rankings** in AI-generated responses
- **More traffic** from high-intent queries
- **More revenue** from buyers who were influenced by the response they received about your brand, with AI acting as a genuine ambassador for your product

And because the agent works continuously, not just when you're at your desk, progress compounds. You wake up to updates. Throughout the day, more tasks complete. Movement toward your goals happens around the clock.

---

### How Communication Works

Lectern communicates with you where you already talk to colleagues.

**Slack, Teams, Email, or wherever you communicate:**

- Receive updates on completed work
- Get asked for approvals when needed
- Provide context or direction to the agent
- Forward relevant information for the agent to remember and use later

It's like communicating with a colleague. You Slack them, they Slack you back. You approve something, they execute. No buttons to click, just conversation.

This is a flexible system. Slack, Teams, and email are the common starting points, but if there's an integration you need, we can go after it.

**The Platform (Home Base):**

- Set up your account and input business information
- Update high-level settings when needed
- Download and share reports
- Adjust strategy or direction

Think of it like the Roomba app. You don't need it daily. You might forget your login. But it's there when something needs adjusting, a safe space to come back to when needed.

---

### The Inbox Flip

Most people dread their inbox. Messages mean work piling up.

Lectern flips that.

When Lectern messages you, whether in Slack, Teams, email, or the in-platform inbox, you're not getting tasks to do. You're getting updates on tasks completed. Occasionally you're asked to approve something. But mostly, your inbox filling up means work is getting done.

Hour by hour. Task by task. Progress toward your goals.

---

## Section 5: Target Audience

### Who We Serve

Lectern serves three primary audiences:

| Audience | Who They Are | What They Need |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Growth-Stage Brands** | VC-backed companies (Series A–C), 11–100 employees, founders still close to GTM | Execution without agency retainers or niche hires |
| **Agencies** | Marketing, PR, or performance agencies serving multiple clients, including AI-native agencies | Scale without headcount; focus on sales, not fulfillment |
| **Revenue & Growth Leaders** | CROs, Growth leads, CMOs, founders, CEOs who own revenue outcomes | A growth agent they can oversee without becoming an AEO expert |

---

### Growth-Stage Brands

**Profile:**
- VC-backed with traction and trajectory
- 11–100 employees
- Founder actively involved in marketing/growth decisions
- Has product-market fit and is scaling
- Performance marketing or growth team present but lean
- Needs results, not reports

**Example:** A YC-backed company, 11–50 employees, recognizable customers, founder-led, growth team present but stretched thin.

**What Lectern does for them:**
- Eliminates the need for agency retainers and their binding contracts
- Removes the need to hire someone with extremely niche AEO knowledge
- Empowers an existing performance marketing lead, growth lead, or even the founder to oversee the agent
- Drives high-intent traffic and revenue without adding headcount

**The transformation:** A lean growth team gets the power of a full performance marketing operation without the overhead.

---

### Agencies

**Profile:**
- Marketing, PR, digital, or performance agencies
- Serving multiple clients with AEO/visibility needs
- Struggling to scale fulfillment without scaling headcount
- Losing margin to execution costs
- Client retention tied to results, not just activity

**What Lectern does for them:**
- Scale output without scaling team size
- Supervise execution rather than do it
- Free up time for sales and client relationships
- Deliver better results with less internal resource drain
- Use reports to show clients clear progress and justify value

**The transformation:** An agency goes from selling a problem and scrambling to fulfill it, to selling a solution with an agent handling the work. Headcount stays flat. Output grows. Margins improve.

**For AI-Native Agencies:**

Lectern is an excellent addition to the "AI-Native Agency" movement. YC is specifically asking for companies like this in their next batch. Lectern solves the AI visibility component for an AI-native agency, an easy plug-and-play solution. If you're building an agency where AI does the work and humans oversee it, Lectern handles the AEO execution layer.

---

### Revenue & Growth Leaders (CROs, Growth Leads, CMOs, Founders, CEOs)

**Profile:**
- Owns revenue outcomes for the company
- May see marketing as a cost center or necessary evil
- Skeptical of agency retainers and unclear deliverables
- Wants results they can measure, not activity they have to interpret
- Doesn't have time to become an AEO expert and doesn't want to

**What Lectern does for them:**
- Positions AEO as a growth function, not a marketing expense
- Saves money on headcount (no niche hire needed)
- Drives high-intent traffic that converts to revenue
- Frees up their time and their team's time for higher-level problems
- Provides reports they can share with investors, boards, and stakeholders

**The transformation:** A CRO, Growth lead, or founder goes from ignoring AI visibility (because it feels like marketing fluff) to overseeing an agent that directly impacts revenue without needing to understand the tactics.

---

### The User vs. The Customer

**Important distinction:**

| | User | Customer |
|---|------|----------|
| **Who they are** | The person using Lectern daily: AEO analyst, performance marketer, agency operator | The person buying Lectern: founder, CRO, CMO, agency owner |
| **What they care about** | Freed-up time, less grunt work, career elevation (analyst to director) | Revenue impact, headcount savings, scalable results |
| **How we talk to them** | "You go from analyst to director. The agent handles execution." | "Save on headcount. Drive revenue. Scale without hiring." |

Both matter. We sell to the customer. We're most useful to the user. Success happens when the user thrives, which keeps the customer paying.

---

### Who We Don't Prioritize for Outbound (Today)

| Segment | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Enterprise (for now)** | Longer sales cycles, procurement complexity. We'll grow alongside our clients; today's growth-stage companies are tomorrow's enterprise brands. |
| **Early-stage startups** | Not our ICP for early outbound. That said, if they're willing to pay the Starter cost ($200/month), there's no reason to turn them away since the agent does the work and we don't need to discriminate on client type. Just not where we focus outreach. |
| **Companies looking for just a dashboard** | We're not a reporting tool. We're an execution agent. If you want insights without action, we're not the fit. |

---

## Section 6: Competitive Positioning

### The Landscape

The AEO space is crowded with platforms promising AI visibility. Most follow the same playbook:
- Track how your brand shows up in AI models
- Provide recommendations on what to improve
- Offer tools to help you create content
- Integrate with your CMS to publish onsite

They've built better vacuums. Powerful. Feature-rich. Still requires you to push it around.

Lectern is more like a Roomba. You set it up, give it a goal, and it runs while you focus on other things.

### The Core Differentiator

Every competitor in this space shares the same gap: no offsite execution capability.

They can help you optimize your site. They can help you create content. They can even help you publish that content to your own properties.

But when it comes to placing content on external, credible sources that AI actually references, the sources that build citation authority, they have nothing. You're on your own.

And alongside that gap, they add more work. More recommendations to interpret. More tasks to execute. More things on your plate.

Lectern can actually place that content. Our publishing network of 1,400+ outlets, built over four years through Presscart, is the execution engine for offsite content. And instead of telling you what to do, the agent tells you what got done. This is the moat.

### Why This Moat Matters

Competitors in AEO have no non-software defensibility. When big AI firms can spin up software-based competitors quickly, the only protection is something they can't replicate overnight.

- Dashboards can be copied
- Recommendation engines can be rebuilt
- CMS integrations are commoditized
- Publishing relationships across 1,400+ credible outlets cannot be spun up in a quarter

This is why Lectern can execute where others can only recommend.

### Two Dimensions of Differentiation

**1. Full-Spectrum Execution (Onsite + Offsite)**

| Capability | Competitors | Lectern |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| AI visibility tracking | Yes | Yes |
| Content recommendations | Yes | Yes |
| Onsite content creation | Yes (with AI help) | Yes (agent executes) |
| CMS publishing | Yes | On roadmap |
| Offsite placements | No capability | 1,400+ outlets |

**2. Autonomous Execution (Agent vs. Tools)**

| Dimension | Competitors | Lectern |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **What they deliver** | Recommendations + tools | Completed work |
| **Who does the work** | You (with AI assistance) | The agent (with your approval) |
| **What they say** | "Here's what you should do" | "Here's what we did" |
| **Your role** | Operator | Director |
| **Inbox experience** | Tasks to do | Progress updates |

### Competitor Overview

**Profound** (tryprofound.com)
- Position: GenAI marketing intelligence platform
- Audience: Enterprise-focused, though they do offer growth-stage pricing ($100/mo and $399/mo tiers)
- Strength: Visibility analytics, competitive intelligence, strong funding ($58M+)
- Gap: No execution capability, no publishing network. Shows you the problem but can't fix it, and adds more work to your plate.
- Lectern advantage: Same intelligence plus full execution through our agent and publisher network. The agent tells you what got done, not what you need to do.

**AirOps**
- Position: Content engineering platform
- Audience: Marketing teams
- Strength: Content creation at scale, workflow automation
- Gap: Weak AI-specific positioning, focused on content production not visibility outcomes. No offsite capability.
- Lectern advantage: Purpose-built for AEO with full-spectrum execution including offsite

**Conductor**
- Position: Enterprise AEO platform
- Audience: Enterprise
- Strength: Legacy SEO reputation, enterprise relationships
- Gap: Legacy SEO company retrofitting for AI. Overcrowded positioning. No offsite publishing.
- Lectern advantage: Built for AEO from day one. Growth-stage friendly. Offsite execution.

**Peec AI**
- Position: AI Search Analytics platform
- Audience: Marketing teams
- Strength: Strong traction ($4M ARR in 9 months), 1,300+ customers, good European presence
- Gap: Analytics only, no execution. Shows you where you stand but you still do the work.
- Lectern advantage: Same visibility insights plus full autonomous execution

**Limy** (Adjacent, not direct competitor)
- Position: AI agent visibility infrastructure
- What they do: Track what AI agents see when they crawl your site (input-side optimization)
- Relationship: Different layer of the stack. They optimize your house; we get you mentioned in the neighborhood. Potentially complementary.

### The Summary Table

| Competitor | What They Do | Their Gap | Lectern Advantage |
|------------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Profound** | Intelligence + content recommendations | No offsite, no autonomous execution, adds work | Intelligence + full execution + work done for you |
| **AirOps** | Content at scale | No offsite, no AEO focus | AEO-native + offsite execution |
| **Conductor** | Enterprise AEO analytics | Legacy positioning, no offsite | Built for AEO, growth-stage, offsite |
| **Peec AI** | AI visibility analytics | Analytics only, no execution | Same insights + agent does the work |
| **Limy** | Agent-side tracking | Onsite only, different problem | Different layer, complementary |

### Battle Cards

**When a prospect mentions Profound:**
> "Profound has strong analytics and serious funding. But they stop at the report. They can show you where you're invisible but they can't make you visible. And every insight they give you is another task on your plate. Lectern shows you the gap and closes it through our publishing network and autonomous agent. They give you a to-do list. The agent gives you completed work."

**When a prospect mentions AirOps:**
> "AirOps is solid for content production, but they're not built for AEO outcomes. They help you create content but you still have to figure out where to place it and do the work. Lectern is purpose-built for AI visibility with full execution, including offsite placements they can't touch."

**When a prospect mentions Peec AI:**
> "Peec has great traction and solid analytics. But once they show you that AI isn't recommending you, what's your plan? They don't execute. Lectern shows you the gap and then the agent closes it, onsite and offsite, while you focus on higher-level work."

**When a prospect mentions Conductor:**
> "Conductor is a legacy SEO company trying to retrofit for AI. Lectern was built for AEO from day one. Plus, they're enterprise-focused with enterprise pricing and enterprise sales cycles. Lectern is built for growth-stage teams who need results now, not a six-month procurement process."

### The One-Line Positioning

Other platforms built powerful tools you still have to operate. Lectern runs autonomously, like a Roomba.

They give you recommendations and tell you what to do. The agent does the work and tells you what got done. They help with onsite. Lectern executes onsite and offsite. They show you the problem. Lectern solves it.

---

## Section 7: Pricing & Tiers

### Philosophy

Simple, per-site pricing. No usage fees. No compute costs. No surprises.

You pick a tier based on what you need:
- How many AI models you want to measure against
- How many priority queries you want to track
- How much content you need created
- How many offsite articles you want published
- What level of support you need from our team

The agent does the work at every tier. The difference is scope, volume, and support.

---

### The Three Tiers

| | **Starter** | **Pro** | **Scale** |
|---|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **Price** | $200/month | $1,000/month | $3,000/month |
| **AI Models** | 1 (ChatGPT) | 3 (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity) | 6 (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Meta AI, Claude, Grok) |
| **Priority Queries** | 50 | 250 | 500 |
| **AI Answers Analyzed** | 3,000/month | 15,000/month | 40,000/month |
| **Onsite Content** | 8 articles/month | 16 articles/month | Daily |
| **Offsite Publishing** | Onsite only | 1 article/month | 4 articles/month |
| **Reporting** | Daily | Daily | Daily |
| **Seats** | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| **Support** | Email | Priority email | Priority email + Slack |

**Onsite Content:** Blog content designed to surface in AI answers

**Offsite Publishing:** Content placed on publications cited by AI models

---

### Pricing Note

Each subscription covers one site. Running multiple brands or client sites? Add additional sites at the same tier rate.

---

### Starter ($200/month)

**Best for:** Early-stage brands, small teams getting started with AEO, founders who want to test before scaling.

**What you get:**
- 1 AI model tracked (ChatGPT)
- 50 priority queries
- 3,000 AI answers analyzed per month
- 8 articles per month
- Daily visibility reports
- Unlimited seats
- Email support

**The value:** Entry point to autonomous AEO execution. The agent still does the work; you're just operating at a smaller scale. Good for companies validating the impact before investing more.

---

### Pro ($1,000/month) — Most Popular

**Best for:** Growth-stage brands scaling their AI visibility, performance marketing teams who need broader coverage, companies with multiple product lines or query categories.

**What you get:**
- 3 AI models tracked (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity)
- 250 priority queries
- 15,000 AI answers analyzed per month
- 16 articles per month
- 1 offsite article per month
- Daily visibility reports
- Unlimited seats
- Priority email support

**The value:** This is where most growth-stage brands land. Broader model coverage, significantly more query tracking, and offsite placements through our publisher network. The jump from Starter to Pro unlocks the full power of offsite execution.

---

### Scale ($3,000/month)

**Best for:** Agencies managing AEO for clients, larger teams with dedicated growth/performance functions, companies needing maximum coverage and dedicated support.

**What you get:**
- 6 AI models tracked (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Meta AI, Claude, Grok)
- 500 priority queries
- 40,000 AI answers analyzed per month
- Daily content creation
- 4 offsite articles per month
- Daily visibility reports
- Unlimited seats
- Priority email + Slack support

**The value:** Maximum coverage, maximum volume, maximum support. For agencies, this tier per client means dedicated Slack access to our team and the full power of Lectern applied to each account. For larger brands with multiple properties, this means comprehensive visibility across every AI model that matters with daily content output and consistent offsite placements for each site.

---

### What Every Tier Includes

Regardless of which plan you choose:

- **The Lectern agent** executing on your behalf
- **AI visibility measurement** across supported models
- **Daily reporting** you can download and share
- **Onsite content** created and optimized (pending your approval)
- **Communication** via Slack, Teams, email, or in-platform
- **Unlimited seats** so your whole team can benefit

The agent works for you at every tier. You're not paying for features that unlock execution; execution is the product.

---

### No Gatekeeping on Execution

Important: We don't gate core execution behind higher tiers.

- Starter gets the agent working on their behalf
- Starter gets content created monthly
- Starter gets progress updates in their inbox

The difference is volume (queries, content, AI answers) and scope (models, offsite placements, support level), not whether the agent actually does the work.

### FAQ

**What does one subscription cover?**
Each subscription covers one site. If you manage multiple sites or brands, each one needs its own subscription at your chosen tier.

**Can I have different tiers for different sites?**
Yes. Each site is independent—you can run one site on Scale and another on Starter. Mix and match based on each site's needs.

### The Value Equation

When evaluating Lectern's price, consider what you're replacing:

| Alternative | Typical Cost | What You Get |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Agency retainer** | $5,000–$15,000/month | Slow execution, unclear deliverables, binding contracts |
| **Niche AEO hire** | $80,000–$120,000/year + benefits | One person, limited bandwidth, ramp-up time |
| **Doing it yourself** | Your time | Opportunity cost of not working on higher-level problems |

Lectern at $200–$3,000/month gives you an agent that works around the clock, executes onsite and offsite, and reports progress to your inbox. No contracts. No hiring. No doing it yourself.

**The math:**
- Save on headcount
- Drive revenue from high-intent traffic
- Free up time for higher-level work

Three ways to see ROI from a single subscription.

## Section 8: Tone, Language & Messaging

### Overall Tone

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Direct** | Say what we mean without corporate fluff |
| **Confident** | We know what we do and who we're for |
| **Founder-friendly** | Speak like a peer, not a vendor |
| **Outcome-focused** | Lead with results, not features |
| **Natural** | Write like a human, not a marketing machine |
| **Warm but professional** | Not stiff, not overly casual |

### What We Sound Like

- A smart founder explaining their company to another founder
- Clear, concise, no jargon for jargon's sake
- Confident without being arrogant
- Helpful without being salesy
- Focused on what gets done, not what you could do
- Natural, conversational prose (not punchy one-liners that scream "AI wrote this")

### What We Don't Sound Like

- Enterprise software marketing ("end-to-end solutions," "leverage synergies")
- Hype-driven startup speak ("revolutionize," "disrupt," "game-changing")
- Vague or hedging ("we help companies potentially improve…")
- Agency speak ("we do the work for you")
- Overly technical without purpose
- Condescending or oversimplified
- Cutesy or gimmicky
- AI-generated copy patterns: short dramatic sentences, excessive em-dashes, try-hard punchlines. If it reads like ChatGPT wrote it, rewrite it.

### Tone Examples

| Instead of… | Write… |
|-------------|--------|
| "Lectern provides a comprehensive suite of AI visibility solutions" | "Lectern measures where you show up in AI and closes the gaps" |
| "Leverage our platform to optimize your presence" | "The agent improves your AI visibility while you focus elsewhere" |
| "We're disrupting the marketing intelligence space" | "Other platforms stop at recommendations. Lectern actually gets it done." |
| "The agent executes. You approve." | "You approve the plan, the agent handles execution, and your inbox fills with progress throughout the day" |
| "Competitors built better vacuums. Lectern built a Roomba." | "Other platforms built powerful tools you still have to operate yourself. Lectern is more like a Roomba: you set it up, give it a goal, and it runs while you focus on other things." |
| "We're not a platform—we're an autonomous agent" | "Lectern isn't a dashboard you log into every day. It's an agent that works autonomously and communicates with you where you already talk to colleagues." |

| Dramatic one-liners as paragraphs | Feels performative, not genuine |
| "X. Y. Z." list-as-sentence structures | Overused by AI, reads as lazy |

### Signature Phrases

Use these as concepts to communicate naturally, not as copy-paste lines:

- The agent handles execution, you approve the direction
- Your inbox fills with completed work throughout the day, not tasks piling up
- Other platforms built powerful tools you still have to operate; Lectern runs autonomously
- Other platforms tell you what to do; Lectern tells you what got done
- Onsite and offsite execution through 1,400+ credible outlets
- Go from analyst doing the work to director overseeing outcomes
- Communicates with you where you already talk to colleagues

**On AI as your brand's ambassador:**

The goal isn't just to get mentioned by AI. It's to have AI responses speak about your brand the way your greatest ambassador would, genuinely recommending your product or service in a way that helps the person asking. This is the organic response from a trusted AI model, not an ad interrupting the experience. When someone asks their AI for advice and your brand comes up naturally, positioned well, that's infinitely more powerful than any paid placement.

### Key Messaging

**Primary Tagline:**

Lectern is an AI visibility agent that measures your gaps, plans your strategy, and handles execution, freeing you to focus on higher-level work instead of scaling headcount or grinding through tasks.

**One-Liner Variations:**

| Context | One-Liner |
|---------|-----------|
| **General** | An AI visibility agent that handles the work so you can focus elsewhere |
| **Outcome-focused** | Turn AI visibility into revenue without adding headcount or workload |
| **Differentiator** | Other platforms stop at recommendations. Lectern actually gets it done. |
| **For growth leaders** | An AI visibility agent you can oversee without becoming an AEO expert or hiring one |
| **For agencies** | Scale AEO execution for clients without scaling your team |
| **Roomba framing** | Other platforms are powerful tools you still have to operate. Lectern runs autonomously: set it up, give it a goal, and let it work while you handle other priorities. |

**The Elevator Pitch:**

Lectern is an AI visibility agent for growth-stage brands and agencies. The agent measures how you show up across AI models like ChatGPT and Gemini, identifies the gaps, builds a plan, and then actually executes: onsite content, offsite placements through our 1,400+ publisher network, competitor monitoring. You approve the direction, the agent handles the rest. Throughout the day, your inbox fills with progress instead of tasks piling up. Other platforms stop at recommendations. Lectern gets it done, so you can focus on higher-level work instead of grinding through execution or scaling headcount to keep up.

### Messaging by Audience

**For Growth Leaders (CROs, CMOs, Founders):**

AI visibility is a revenue problem. Lectern gives you an agent that drives high-intent traffic without adding headcount or requiring you to become an AEO expert. You don't need an agency. You don't need a niche hire. The agent executes, you see results, and your time stays focused on the problems that actually need your attention.

**For Performance Marketing / Growth Teams:**

You're stretched thin and every new priority adds to the pile. Lectern takes AEO execution off your plate entirely. The agent measures, plans, and executes, onsite and offsite. You approve the direction and oversee outcomes. Throughout the day, progress shows up in your inbox instead of more tasks. You go from grinding through execution to directing the work.

**For Agencies:**

Scaling fulfillment used to mean scaling headcount. Lectern is plug-and-play AEO execution for agencies building with AI at the core. The agent handles the work, you supervise, your clients see results, and your team stays focused on sales and relationships instead of fulfillment.
